# tamperfree
A tool for verifying static content Tor Hidden Service websites.

*Please note that this is a prototype only. As such I don't want to make any promises of any real security.
There may be bugs and/or security vulnerabilities*.

## notes
1. Http Works. (Although injection by exit node could mess with results)
2. Https does not work because it's encrypted before it reaches proxy.
3. Tor-hidden service works.


## todo
1. Auto download tor browser.
2. Auto update tor browser.
3. Build verification set(?)
4.
